      <p>I am from the sweet flour, productive work </p>
      <p>I am from the emerald scallion </p>
      <p>I am from Kampong Cham province.</p>
      <p>I’m from kind-hearted and a long road full of advices from parents and grandparents </p>
      <p>I'm from CD and microphone and from television. </p>

      <p>I’m from eggs and variety of Khmer soup </p>
      <p>From an educated person who survived at Khmer Rouge regime, mouth zipped and has to do whatever they told. Flexibility was the thing. He had passed an obstacle course from black zombies. The bird was released in January 1979.</p>  
      <p>I’m from his freedom which is part of who I am today. He meets his belove and created me. I’m from every single sweat and blood and those becoming my hero in my heart forever that can never be dissolved in my memory.</p>
