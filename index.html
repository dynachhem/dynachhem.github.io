      <p> My name is defined as power in English word. It doesn’t mean anything in Khmer. It might be, but probably I don’t realize. In my country (Cambodia), it was named for both genders. So many Khmer celebrities are having this name, footballer, boxer, etc. 
          The reason behind this name is like the bag of M&M. Little did everyone knows, it is also a combination name of my parents. My father’s name is Dyne (Dee-Neh) and my mother's name is Vanna (Van-Nah). Dyna (Dee-Na). The special reason that they named me this was to keep their name to be part of my soul and spirit forever. I definitely love this.
          My parents are energetic, work hard and proactive. My father is a problem-quick solver and my mom is a sweet woman who always encourages and cheers me up. I start to see this world on December 18th, 2004. I inherit half of their names and I want to inherit their personality as well. 
              “Dyna” keeps me to remember my special people who let me see this world forever. I am proud to have this name. I also haven’t seen someone who names their children the combination of their name yet. To be honest, it is the most meaningful name that I’ve ever asked for.</p>

    <p>Currently, I’m studying at Liger Leadership Academy, Phnom Penh, a place that is surrounded by aesthetic nature. I enjoy my time in nature a lot! I got there through a three rounds recruitment. One of the things that I love about being here is to learn how to become a leader and being part of the project that could change my country.</p>

    <p>I love to play frisbee. It is a non-contact team sport played with a flying disc (frisbee). Although Ultimate resembles many traditional sports in its athletic requirements, it is unlike most sports due to its focus on self-officiating, even at the highest levels of competition. This sport reflects players' intergrity by having an ownership to speak up and responsible for any calls during the tournament.</p>

    <p>I really like dogs because they are very friendly and adorable. I do not like snakes because they seem to be so scary for me and I prefer not to see one, because I'm afraid that I would encounter the dangerous one.</p>
